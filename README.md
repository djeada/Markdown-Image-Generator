# Markdown Image Generator

The Markdown Image Generator is a Python-based project that transforms Markdown documents into a series of images. It aims to provide a unique way to visualize Markdown content, especially useful for presentations, sharing over image-based platforms, or even for educational purposes.

## Overview

Markdown, a popular markup language, is widely used for its simplicity and versatility. However, presenting Markdown content in a visually engaging way can be challenging. The Markdown Image Generator addresses this by converting Markdown files into images, making it easier to share and present Markdown content in a more digestible format.
